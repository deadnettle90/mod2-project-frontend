        <h3>The wedding is held at the Twins, and is being hosted by Lord Walder Frey. He greets the royal delegation at the gate:</h3>
        <h4>"My honored guests, be welcome within my walls and at my table. I extend to you my hospitality and protection in the light of the Seven."</h4>
        <h3>The wedding guests settle into the great hall, and feast on wild boar, pigeon pie, and Dornish wine. Half way through the evening, the band begins to play "The Rains of Castamere".</h3>
